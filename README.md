** INSTALLATION GUIDE FOR THE REPOSITORY**
1. If you don't have node.js and npm installed, go to "https://nodejs.org/en/download/", download the "installer" (depends on your device OS) and install it.

2. To check if your node already installed, open your command prompt and write "node -v", after that write "npm -v" to check npm versions. If its already installed, you should see the version of your node and npm.

3. After finish installing node and npm, type "npm install" in the terminal(or similar things as terminal) to install all of the dependencies. If you're not using VScode and using windows, you can use command prompt to run this command, but remember to open your command prompt on your current local project folders (ex: D:/work/project/loket-reservation), unless it won't work as intended.
