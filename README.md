** GUIDE TO INSTALL Node.js **
1. If you don't have node.js and npm installed, go to "https://nodejs.org/en/download/", download the "installer" (depends on your device OS) and install it.

2. To check if your node already installed, open your command prompt and write "node -v", after that write "npm -v" to check npm versions. If its already installed, you should see the version of your node and npm.

3. Open your IDE (I'm using VScode, but you can use other IDE), open your terminal, and type "npm init -y". This will generate "package.json" with its default value in it (Don't worry, you can change the package.json if you want) . You can also use "npm init" to customize your package.json before generating it.
